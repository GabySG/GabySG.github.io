                                <p>We conducted <b>semi-structured interviews</b>, <b>contextual inquiries</b>, and distribute a <b>survey</b> to identify problems that used-bike buyers and sellers meet. Based on the data gathered, we did <b>affinity diagram</b> to categorize collected data, whose findings are used to develop user personas.</p> 

                                <p>These processes helped us understand our users better, and we <b>identified 6 problems</b> in their buying and selling experience of second-hand bikes. Considering their user scale and influence, we <b>converged to 2 problems</b>. Then we organized divergent <b>brainstorming design</b> sessions with 19 divergent design ideas. After doing a thorough analysis of their feasibility, creativity and to the biggest extent they can solve 2 main problems, we then converged to 2 design ideas.</p>

                                <p>The 2 ideas were presented to our class peers for feedback and evaluation by <b>storyboards</b>, <b>wireframes</b>. After multiple iterations, we finally came up with a system called <b>SecondBuy</b> with a <b>mobile app</b> and a <b>physical bike station</b>.</p><br/><br/>

                                <p>We initially conducted semi-structured interviews with potential users to find out the reasons behind their purchase, where they have looked for a used bike and what problems they have faced. Then, we decided to have an in-depth understanding of purchasing experience by doing contextual inquiry. After the first two steps, we distributed a survey with close-end questions which we are sure about the problem scope and open-end questions, which might bring us more surprises.</p><br/>

                                <h2><p><br/><br/>Solution</p></h2>
                                <p>Some of the ideas we brainstormed are as follows:</p><br/>
                                <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Trusting the seller and quality of product</b></p></li>
                                   <ol>
                                       <li>All personal information such as cellphone number,  ID verification should be registered in one account. Sellers need to login with GTID to verify they belongs to the GT community.</li>
                                       <li>Drop and pick up the bike at a specific place. The buyers can get the code for a box and get the bike key to avoid going to the seller’s home to get the bike.</li>
                                       <li>Once one account has made anything out of rule, it would be listed as a black list and cannot register again.</li>
                                       <li>Trust score from every friend. Sharing the link of your selling bike and call for friends to press like for your bike. The more like you got, the more credit you can get for your trust score.</li>
                                       <li>Let previous buyer of other bike examine the bike by a required instruction. They may try on the bike and write reviews about the selling bike.</li>
                                       <li>Give free examination to promote after-sale reviews for the examination people’s work.</li>
                                       <li>Set up community about second-hand buying and selling. In the community, people can share their experience about selling or buying bike so that other people can learn from their experience and know how to buy an appropriate bike.</li>
                                       <li>Let <b>expert</b> examine the quality of bike and write reviews on each part. The expert can also help to repair the bike. Then they can upload warranty pic to show the quality of bike is guaranteed.</li>
                                       <li>Post a link of the same new product in Amazon and Target, which may help users to know the original quality.</li>
                                       <li>Set up a device to keep track of the bike since it has been bought rote details about how long have used it, what sound do it have and past repairment.</li>
                                       <li>Gave an instruction at each part’s condition which is required to post information on website.</li>
                                       <li>Ensure 2-day non-compensation return and 3-month free repair for future repairment to guarantee after-sale service.</li>
                                       <li>Post a video when riding on bike. The <b>video</b> can give users an idea about whether the bike can ride well or not. What the size of the bike.</li><br/>

                                        <li><b>Instant buy</b>: buyers enter their anticipation for the range of price and preference for size and weight of the bike. Then the system will automatically match a bike for the buyer. He then can pay for it and get the bike.</li>
                                        <li>Offer last-minute bikes in the first homepage with a cheap price to promote purchase.</li>

                            <p>Our analysis gave us <b>3</b> major design ideas to work with: <b>Video</b> based product listing, <b>Expert community</b>, and <b>Instant Buy</b>.</p>
                            <ol>
<!-- Video -->
                            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 xs-height-auto display-table text-left xs-no-padding height=400px" style="text-align: justify">
                            <b><li>
                                Video based product listing</li></b>
                                <p>In this design, the company staff would help take video descriptions of second-hand bikes. The staff will collect the bike at the seller’s home/pick up points and shoot a video with one model riding the bike and other videos about details of the bike. This design would address problems of trusting the quality of bike, time consuming to post the bike, unsure about the cycle height from online image, features not clear, delivery and accessibility.</p>
                                
                            <ul>
                                <b><li>Working Flow</li></b>
                                <p>Potential sellers contact Second Buy first and schedule appointments to meet. Second Buy sends a staff to collect bikes from sellers at designated location and time. Once the bikes are collected, staff from community will shoot a set of standard videos of one model riding the bike in different environments and then record a 360° video of the bike including several close-up shots of the bike. The video would be documented and edited in an uniformed format to ensure that buyers could have a more clear and comprehensive picture of the bikes. After shooting, staff would post the videos on the system with the descriptive information of bikes and models for reference.</p>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                <p>Based on our research, we noticed that people found it difficult to buy a second-hand bike because they knew too little about sellers from online post information to trust. And for sellers, they indicated that it could be very hard and time-consuming to establish the trust with buyers by any means.<br/><br/>  
                                Our design idea firstly has staff or volunteers collect bikes from sellers, which greatly save seller’s time of finding a selling platform and negotiation with buyers. And most importantly, SecondBuy community becomes the only actual “seller”. Thus buyers don’t need to worry about whether individual seller is integrity or not. And for most of time, people would rather trust a community than an individual.<br/><br/>  
                                As for the videos, recording a set of standard videos of bikes cannot only showcase how the bikes look like and work under different conditions, but can also let buyers have more sense of the height and size of the bikes by referring to the information of specific bike models without physically trying them out.<br/><br/> 
                                In most selling platforms today, uploading video is not compulsory. This is partly because most sellers don’t have time to do such detailed listing processes. Which is why in our design we have included a staff member to upload videos. Each video will be shown on the Bike Listing on the app/website. The video can also provide buyers with better comparison about what different bike’s size and weight would be. Comparing how the model looks like when riding the bike can give them more direct sense of the strengths and weakness of different bikes.<br/><br/>
                                The idea behind having video descriptions was to reduce the need to physically check the bike’s quality. The videos supplemented by close up shots of the bike we believe would help the potential buyer estimate the quality of the bike.<br/></p>

                                Expert Community</li></b>
                                <p>This is a community based vetting and review for bikes sold. In this model, each transaction has 3 key participants - the buyer, the seller, and the expert. Expert community is conducted to mainly solve the trust problem.</p>
                                
                            <ul>
                                <b><li>Working Flow</li></b>
                                <p>First, the seller posts a request for selling his/her bike. Each sell post would include basic information like the bike type, images, and the seller’s location. Once a seller submits a sell post for their bike, an expert closest to the seller is identified and notified to examine the condition of the bike. The expert visits the seller’s bike, performs a detailed analysis and makes evaluations on the condition of the bike - what is damaged, what is working, close-up images, video walk arounds and test videos, and then finally gives a review. If there is a need, the expert will also repair the bike, and make notes of the same on the product listing. The expert’s review is then posted online for all potential buyers to see. Buyers can verify the authenticity of the post given the detailed information that comes with it. Each buyer can also rate the expert, post purchase to complete the feedback loop.<br/><br/>
                                These experts can review multiple bikes, and anybody has the chance to become an expert post inspection by the company. If the buyer is satisfied with his/her purchase, the seller is paid (within 24-48h). The expert receives a percentage commission for his/her effort</p>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                <p>Lack of trust has been issued as a big concern for most customers. We brought up this idea with a third-party authorized expert to examine required details and they, rather than sellers, are responsible for posting the bike. Given that the expert is evaluated too, we believe the system would self regulate to provide an honest bike review system, and help solve the trust problem. By checking the quality of the bike, the expert will serve as a third party to provide more objective feedback about the bike.<br/><br/> 
                                For this design idea, the expert will have a step-by-step guide to look for while inspecting the quality of the bike. This would guarantee that the buyers feel more secure about buying that bike. Another important part of this design is that the expert is reviewed and rated too. This feedback loop in the design will help buyers trust the quality of the bike.<br/><br/>
                                The goal was to have a standardised metric for trustworthiness of products sold. We wanted some means to help buyers take one glance at the listing and judge how good the bike was going to be. For this, the bike needs to be vetting by somebody who can distinguish between good and poor quality bikes. Which is why we included an expert in our design. However, we realised that employing experts wouldn’t be a scalable solution, and hence the community of experts. Our inspiration was the Uber driver model, where anybody can find work at any time. We believe through this model, experts can earn income by reviewing bikes for sale.<br/></p>

The customer would have two options: “Yes” to accept this offer or “Reload” to reject and look for another one. If the buyer chooses to accept the bike, the buyer will be shown another window to pay for the bike. After finishing the purchase process, the buyer will receive information about where to collect the bike. The buyer will also receive the code of the bike to unlock the bike.<br/><br/>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                One of the biggest pain points of customers is that customers are always looking for low-price bikes. During an interview, a participant responded that when he looked for a second hand bike he just wanted a basic one without elaborate functions. This feedback also matched our result from surveys. The interviewee said he just a basic one with good quality and what he cared was whether it would work well. Moreover, we also found that they always tend to spend most of the time in negotiating the price and looking for low-price bikes. Especially for people those who do not look for specific requirements of a used bike, price might be their foremost, or even the only concern. The survey result also showed that the most important reason for buying second hand bike is because it is cheap.<br/><br/>
                                So our design idea here is to help solve these pain points by minimizing the comparing process. Since we found that the price is what user are most concerned about and their requirements for the bike is not so specific. We design the ‘instant buy’ as a system where the user just enters their budget and then are given a single choice for a bike. We believe this design can meet user’s need and solve their problem too. Also the bike’s quality is ensured by the volunteer.<br/><br/> 
                                The goal in the pickup and drop location was to understand how buyers and sellers could meet at a common location that is accessible for both. The simplest way to represent accessibility was through a map. We decided to let sellers first share their location on a map, on where they plan to have their bike. We would also give the seller a lock operated by the app to use to lock the bike. The reason was to avoid exchange of keys between all the parties involved in the transaction - since that would be tedious and time-consuming.<br/><br/> 
                                Once the drop is done, we wanted to notify the staff to take videos of the bike. This design would also solve the delivery problem. The buyer and seller can arrange the time and save their time on negotiation on where to meet.<br/></p>

Based on our four rounds of <b>cognitive walkthroughs</b>, we got valuable advices about UI design, task flow and details of features.<br/><br/>
                                Some of the advices are:
                                    <li>Change the height metric from “cm” to “inch” since inch is the metric here in the States.<br/></li>
                                    <li>Add a page between the seller choosing a place to lock the bike and getting a confirmation message after locking the bike, with information about scheduling to drop the bike later<br/></li>
                                    <li>Add a feature in the main page where the user can enter her height and an image is shown comparing the user’s height against that of the bike (so that the first time buyer can know if the bike fits)<br/></li>
                                    <li>Better design of search and filter. Unsure what to search for.<br/></li>
                                    <li>The icons describing the functions need to be clearer, maybe some text explanation. <br/></li>
                                </p>
                                <p>So we consider these reviews when making the <b>Hi-Fi interaction prototype</b>(See it on webpage).</p>
