                                Headphones are now used to listen to music and podcasts or you can use them to speak to others during a call. They are used while working out, gaming, walking, or just lounging around. However, choosing a pair of suitable headphones sometimes are exhausting.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Our project is to help headphone users to</b><br/><br/>
                                o	Help them to quickly spot the headphone they need & want<br/>
                                o	Decrease the time they were looking for the ideal one in a physical store<br/><br/><br/>

                                <h2><p>My role</p></h2>
                                <p>I participated throughout the research process of <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>interviews</b> and <b>survey</b>. I took charge of the <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>affinity diagram</b>, and skeching <b>journey maps</b> and <b>personas</b> by collecting the findings. I also came up with two main design ideas which ended up as our final solution. Besides, I created Lo-fi design via <b>Balsamiq</b> and Hi-fi designs via <b>Sketch</b>.</p>
                                </div><br/>
                                
                                <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                                <h2><p>Approach</p></h2>
                                <p>The team started with two kinds of online websites (with all brands and websites with one specific brand) for headphones information. Then we conducted in-person <b>observations</b> and <b>semi-structured interviews</b> to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behavior.</p>
                                
                                <p>Then we did <b>contextual inquiries</b>, and distributed a <b>survey</b> to identify problems that they face during purchasing in a physical store. Based on the data gathered, we did <b>affinity diagram</b> to categorize collected data. We used findings from the affinity diagram to develop user journey maps and personas.</p>  

                                <p>These processes helped us understand our users better, and we identified problems in their headphone-purchasing experience. Then we organized divergent brainstorming <b>design</b> sessions with divergent design ideas. After doing a thorough analysis of their feasibility, creativity and to the biggest extent they can solve main problems, we then converged to # design ideas.</p> 

                                <p>The ideas were presented to our class peers for feedback and evaluation by <b>storyboards</b>, <b>wireframes</b>. After multiple iterations, we came up with a mobile application called Nama-slay with a detailed user flow.</p>

                                <p>We initially conducted observations to observe their purchase process. They we did semi-structured interviews with users to find out the reasons behind their purchase, where they have looked for and what problems they have faced, and with salesperson who can share a summary of their interactions with users and best-selling products. After the first two steps, we distributed a survey with close-end questions which we are sure about the problem scope and open-end questions, which might bring us more surprises.</p>

                                <p>Then we decided to have an in-depth understanding of purchasing experience by doing contextual inquiry. After combining results of first-round survey and contextual inquiry, we did a second-round survey, which focused more on their thinking of problems what we extracted.</p><br/>

                                <p>We conducted several in-person observations and semi-structured interviews at many local stores such as Best Buy, Apple, Target, and Barnes and Noble. We chose those research methods, since our objective was to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behaviour. We did not want to go with a structured interview or a survey initially, since we did not have sufficient information yet, to delve deeper into the problems buyers face currently.</p></div>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>At the Barnes and Noble we visited, there were two separate locations within the electronics section where headphones were displayed. One location had colorful packages of various brands of earbuds such as Skullcandy and Gumy. All of the headphones in this section had price tags. Items in this section were arranged by price, generally the cheapest ($9.98-$30) ones were the most accessible, followed the next price bracket (>$40) being in the locked lower section of the rack. The most expensive headphones (>$100) were kept in the top section. The other section was a small counter where speakers and headphones were set up for the purpose of letting customers try them on. There were no prices listed in this section. We noticed after multiple visits that these headphones were changed on occasion, though we are uncertain of the interval at which these products are swapped out.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Apple Store had mostly Beats headphones throughout the store, possibly due to their branding strategies, and their deal of offering a pair of Beats headphones with the purchase of a Macbook. They had locations where you could listen to various sets of over-ear headphones, as well as a place to hook your phone into the headphones. The other brands that they offered were i.am+, Pioneer, Freedom, and Bose. However, these other brands were often higher up on the shelves, and the Beats headphones were always at eye level. They also had sale associates there ready to help and answer any questions the consumers might have.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

                                <p><br/>At the Target that we visited, there was only one aisle dedicated to headphones in the electronics section. The layout seemed very condensed compared to other stores we visited. On the side closer to the main walkway, there were brightly lit displays with singular pairs of headphones being shown off, and slightly further in, the displays had some headphones that you could try on. Beats had the largest display there, but there were also displays for Skullcandy, Jaybird, and UBL brand headphones. Underneath these displays were locked cabinets containing boxes of the headphones displayed below, whose prices ranged from $100-$200.</p>
                                <p>Past the displays, there were simply racks of wireless headphones in boxes. These wireless headphones ranged from $50-$200 in price and were locked to the racks themselves. With expensive items on display, it is not surprising that Target would like to deter shoplifting.</p>
                                <p>Further along was a rack full of earbuds. Simply packaged, mostly on sale, and none of them locked. These headphones were never more than $30, and must have been left unlocked as they were not worth the deterrent.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/>We visited two different Best Buy locations with slightly different layouts. However, there were features between the stores that were similar. All of the racks were about 5-6 feet tall, allowing for some customers to see over them. The stores had 2 aisles dedicated to headphones. One aisle was dedicated to displays with headphones to try on, where the headphones had specialty controls, and video displays that would show off various features of the headphones. Below those displays, there were various boxes of headphones from similar brands. The brands on this aisle were mostly Sony, Skullcandy, and Beats headphones. On the other Aisle, there were more displays for trying on headphones (Bose), but the other half of the aisle was a rack of wireless headphones and earbuds. When speaking to a store representative, they said that the most common feature they were asked about was comfort, which may have led to more space in the store being used for trying on headphones. There were also sections where a customer could plug in their phone to use their own sound to test the headphones.</p><br/></div>

                            <h2><p>User evaluation</p></h2><br/>
                            <div class="text-large tz-text width-120 sm-width-100">
                            <p>In this step, we showed three different sketches and working flow to experts, during when they were asked how they think of the sketch works.In order to avoid ordering bias during these studies, we switched the order on our designs up between the studies.  We had <br/><i><center>A: the kiosk design, B: The LED design, and C: the personal assistant app design.</center></i> <center>We switched the order of presentation between ABC, CAB, BCA, etc for various users.</center><br/> We started with a quick introduction for the participants, explaining that they were looking at concepts for various systems that may improve the headphone shopping experience.  We made sure to inform them that any comments, even negative ones, would be useful for improving and refining these designs.

After the introduction, we took the users through the designs one by one and asked them a series of questions.<br/><br/>
<b>Show them the pages for each design<br/><br/></b>

                            <i><center><br/>“Please look at the first screen for this design.  Take a minute to look over it all and try to think aloud as you do so.<br/> If you have any questions, feel free to ask about them”.</center><br/></i>(if we’re asked “what does this do?”, ask them what they think it does before we give them an answer. Getting people to think about these things further will give us insight into what people think something is before us just giving the answer to them)<br/><br/>

By doing this, we got the users basic impressions of each screen.  The thinking aloud made them more likely to vocalise interest, frustration, and confusion about various features.  When the researcher needed further context about what they were reacting to, the researcher would ask.<br/><br/>

Explain to them the purpose of this page, and ask follow up questions now that this was to reset the user if they were altogether confused about that particular screen.<br/><br/>

<i><center><br/>"Is there any part of this screen that you particularly like or dislike?"</center><br/></i>

The above question got at what were the important features to that user, and which ones were not necessary.  This was useful in finding out what to add, as well as what things we as a team liked, but were useless to the average user.<br/><br/>
                                
<center><br/>"Is there any feature that you would like added to this screen?  If so, what is that feature?"</center><br/>

By asking this question, we could find out if we had missed any important features in our design process. One such feature ended up being back buttons.
We repeat these steps for the rest of the pages of that design.<br/><br/>

<b>Ask about the design as a whole<br/><br/></b>

I. After getting design info about each part of a sketch, we then wanted them to see everything in context.<br/><br/>

<i><center><br/>“On a scale from 1-5, with 1 being not at all useful and 5 being extremely useful, how useful do you think this design would be?”</center></i>
<i><center>“Knowing the whole context of the design, are there any features that stand out to you?  Is this in a positive or negative way?”</center></i>
<i><center>"Please share any other thoughts you have about this design, or any of the features involved."</center><br/></i>

It’s always good to ask a user for their own thoughts on a design, as they may think of something that you didn’t.<br/><br/>

II. After having shown them all 3 designs<br/><br/>

<i><center><br/>“Which of these designs would you be most likely to use in a store?”</center><br/></i>

This question was a direct query for one of our objectives. By asking the user which one they would be most likely to use, it would force them to think more about their actual use of the designs, and not just which one they liked the most.<br/><br/>

After finishing the feedback sessions for the sketches, we proceeded to <b>design a wireframe for the <u>Kiosk</u>.</b>
<br/><br/>
                                <b>Reasons supporting this decision are:</b><br/><br/>
                                    <li>People like the way that they can get recommendations of headphone by inputing their requirements in use, style and feature.<br/></li>
                                    <li>People don't feel like using their own cellphone connected to a physical store in terms of security.<br/></li>
                                    <li>People find the lED annoying if they light up everytime a customer changes the requirements.<br/></li>
                                    <li>People like the navigation idea.<br/></li>
                                    <li>People love the icons.<br/></li>
                                </p>
                                <p>So we consider these reviews when making the <b>Lo-Fi</b> prototype of the kiosk by <b>combining things people like in three designs separately.</b></p>

                            <p><br/>After sharing with all teammates the Lo-Fi prototype and getting some improvements based on people's great advices. Then I began to polish our Hi-Fi prototype in Sketch.<b> Some changes are:</b><br/></p>
                                    <li>Change the first landing page as a ClickToAction page.<br/></li>
                                    <li>Offer Skip button in the second page so that people can directly browse every heaphone in the store.<br/></li>
                                    <li>Remove the page that users can input a brand name and model type. Because if people know what they are looking for, chances are they don't need recommendation from our service anymore. Again, we want to serve for the people who are strugging with which pair of headphone to choose from.<br/></li>
                                    <li>Add a homepage logo int the top left corner of every page so that if one customer leave the kiosk halfway, another customer can easily get access to the main page by cliking at it.<br/></li>
