                                The chosen product of our project is headphones, which has a large user base. Headphones are now used to listen to music and podcasts or you can use them to speak to others during a call. They are used while working out, gaming, walking, or just lounging around. They have many uses and purposes, making them an interesting and fun product to explore.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Our project is to help headphone users to</b><br/><br/>
                                o	Help them to quickly spot the headphone they need & want<br/>
                                o	Decrease the time they were looking for the ideal one in a physical store<br/><br/><br/>
                                
                                
                                <h2><p>Approach</p></h2>
                                <p>The team started with two kinds of online websites (with all brands and websites with one specific brand) for headphones information. Then we conducted in-person <b>observations</b> and <b>semi-structured interviews</b> to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behavior.</p>
                                
                                <p>Then we did <b>contextual inquiries</b>, and distributed a <b>survey</b> to identify problems that they face during purchasing in a physical store. Based on the data gathered, we did <b>affinity diagram</b> to categorize collected data. We used findings from the affinity diagram to develop user journey maps and personas.</p>  

                                <p>These processes helped us understand our users better, and we identified problems in their headphone-purchasing experience. Then we organized divergent brainstorming <b>design</b> sessions with divergent design ideas. After doing a thorough analysis of their feasibility, creativity and to the biggest extent they can solve main problems, we then converged to # design ideas.</p> 

                                <p>The ideas were presented to our class peers for feedback and evaluation by <b>storyboards</b>, <b>wireframes</b>. After multiple iterations, we came up with a mobile application called Nama-slay with a detailed user flow.</p> 
                                
                                
                                <h2><p>My role</p></h2>
                                <p>I participated throughout the research process of <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>interviews</b> and <b>survey</b>. I took charge of the <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>affinity diagram</b>, and skeching <b>journey maps</b> and <b>personas</b> by collecting the findings. I also came up with two main design ideas which ended up as our final solution. Besides, I created Lo-fi Hi-fi designs via <b>Axure</b>, <b>Sketch</b> and <b>Figma</b>.</p>

                                <p>We initially conducted observations to observe their purchase process. They we did semi-structured interviews with users to find out the reasons behind their purchase, where they have looked for and what problems they have faced, and with salesperson who can share a summary of their interactions with users and best-selling products. After the first two steps, we distributed a survey with close-end questions which we are sure about the problem scope and open-end questions, which might bring us more surprises.</p>

                                <p>Then we decided to have an in-depth understanding of purchasing experience by doing contextual inquiry. After combining results of first-round survey and contextual inquiry, we did a second-round survey, which focused more on their thinking of problems what we extracted.</p><br/>

                                <p>We conducted several in-person observations and semi-structured interviews at many local stores such as Best Buy, Apple, Target, and Barnes and Noble. We chose those research methods, since our objective was to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behaviour. We did not want to go with a structured interview or a survey initially, since we did not have sufficient information yet, to delve deeper into the problems buyers face currently.</p></div>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>At the Barnes and Noble we visited, there were two separate locations within the electronics section where headphones were displayed. One location had colorful packages of various brands of earbuds such as Skullcandy and Gumy. All of the headphones in this section had price tags. Items in this section were arranged by price, generally the cheapest ($9.98-$30) ones were the most accessible, followed the next price bracket (>$40) being in the locked lower section of the rack. The most expensive headphones (>$100) were kept in the top section. The other section was a small counter where speakers and headphones were set up for the purpose of letting customers try them on. There were no prices listed in this section. We noticed after multiple visits that these headphones were changed on occasion, though we are uncertain of the interval at which these products are swapped out.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Apple Store had mostly Beats headphones throughout the store, possibly due to their branding strategies, and their deal of offering a pair of Beats headphones with the purchase of a Macbook. They had locations where you could listen to various sets of over-ear headphones, as well as a place to hook your phone into the headphones. The other brands that they offered were i.am+, Pioneer, Freedom, and Bose. However, these other brands were often higher up on the shelves, and the Beats headphones were always at eye level. They also had sale associates there ready to help and answer any questions the consumers might have.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

                                <p><br/>At the Target that we visited, there was only one aisle dedicated to headphones in the electronics section. The layout seemed very condensed compared to other stores we visited. On the side closer to the main walkway, there were brightly lit displays with singular pairs of headphones being shown off, and slightly further in, the displays had some headphones that you could try on. Beats had the largest display there, but there were also displays for Skullcandy, Jaybird, and UBL brand headphones. Underneath these displays were locked cabinets containing boxes of the headphones displayed below, whose prices ranged from $100-$200.</p>
                                <p>Past the displays, there were simply racks of wireless headphones in boxes. These wireless headphones ranged from $50-$200 in price and were locked to the racks themselves. With expensive items on display, it is not surprising that Target would like to deter shoplifting.</p>
                                <p>Further along was a rack full of earbuds. Simply packaged, mostly on sale, and none of them locked. These headphones were never more than $30, and must have been left unlocked as they were not worth the deterrent.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/>We visited two different Best Buy locations with slightly different layouts. However, there were features between the stores that were similar. All of the racks were about 5-6 feet tall, allowing for some customers to see over them. The stores had 2 aisles dedicated to headphones. One aisle was dedicated to displays with headphones to try on, where the headphones had specialty controls, and video displays that would show off various features of the headphones. Below those displays, there were various boxes of headphones from similar brands. The brands on this aisle were mostly Sony, Skullcandy, and Beats headphones. On the other Aisle, there were more displays for trying on headphones (Bose), but the other half of the aisle was a rack of wireless headphones and earbuds. When speaking to a store representative, they said that the most common feature they were asked about was comfort, which may have led to more space in the store being used for trying on headphones. There were also sections where a customer could plug in their phone to use their own sound to test the headphones.</p><br/></div>

This design would address problems of trusting the quality of bike, time consuming to post the bike, unsure about the cycle height from online image, features not clear, delivery and accessibility.</p>

                                <p>Potential sellers contact Second Buy first and schedule appointments to meet. Second Buy sends a staff to collect bikes from sellers at designated location and time. Once the bikes are collected, staff from community will shoot a set of standard videos of one model riding the bike in different environments and then record a 360° video of the bike including several close-up shots of the bike. The video would be documented and edited in an uniformed format to ensure that buyers could have a more clear and comprehensive picture of the bikes. After shooting, staff would post the videos on the system with the descriptive information of bikes and models for reference.</p>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                <p>Based on our research, we noticed that people found it difficult to buy a second-hand bike because they knew too little about sellers from online post information to trust. And for sellers, they indicated that it could be very hard and time-consuming to establish the trust with buyers by any means.<br/><br/>  
                                Our design idea firstly has staff or volunteers collect bikes from sellers, which greatly save seller’s time of finding a selling platform and negotiation with buyers. And most importantly, SecondBuy community becomes the only actual “seller”. Thus buyers don’t need to worry about whether individual seller is integrity or not. And for most of time, people would rather trust a community than an individual.<br/><br/>  
                                As for the videos, recording a set of standard videos of bikes cannot only showcase how the bikes look like and work under different conditions, but can also let buyers have more sense of the height and size of the bikes by referring to the information of specific bike models without physically trying them out.<br/><br/> 
                                In most selling platforms today, uploading video is not compulsory. This is partly because most sellers don’t have time to do such detailed listing processes. Which is why in our design we have included a staff member to upload videos. Each video will be shown on the Bike Listing on the app/website. The video can also provide buyers with better comparison about what different bike’s size and weight would be. Comparing how the model looks like when riding the bike can give them more direct sense of the strengths and weakness of different bikes.<br/><br/>
                                The idea behind having video descriptions was to reduce the need to physically check the bike’s quality. The videos supplemented by close up shots of the bike we believe would help the potential buyer estimate the quality of the bike.<br/></p>

                                <p>This is a community based vetting and review for bikes sold. In this model, each transaction has 3 key participants - the buyer, the seller, and the expert. Expert community is conducted to mainly solve the trust problem.</p>
                                
                            <ul>
                                <b><li>Working Flow</li></b>
                                <p>First, the seller posts a request for selling his/her bike. Each sell post would include basic information like the bike type, images, and the seller’s location. Once a seller submits a sell post for their bike, an expert closest to the seller is identified and notified to examine the condition of the bike. The expert visits the seller’s bike, performs a detailed analysis and makes evaluations on the condition of the bike - what is damaged, what is working, close-up images, video walk arounds and test videos, and then finally gives a review. If there is a need, the expert will also repair the bike, and make notes of the same on the product listing. The expert’s review is then posted online for all potential buyers to see. Buyers can verify the authenticity of the post given the detailed information that comes with it. Each buyer can also rate the expert, post purchase to complete the feedback loop.<br/><br/>
                                These experts can review multiple bikes, and anybody has the chance to become an expert post inspection by the company. If the buyer is satisfied with his/her purchase, the seller is paid (within 24-48h). The expert receives a percentage commission for his/her effort</p>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                <p>Lack of trust has been issued as a big concern for most customers. We brought up this idea with a third-party authorized expert to examine required details and they, rather than sellers, are responsible for posting the bike. Given that the expert is evaluated too, we believe the system would self regulate to provide an honest bike review system, and help solve the trust problem. By checking the quality of the bike, the expert will serve as a third party to provide more objective feedback about the bike.<br/><br/> 
                                For this design idea, the expert will have a step-by-step guide to look for while inspecting the quality of the bike. This would guarantee that the buyers feel more secure about buying that bike. Another important part of this design is that the expert is reviewed and rated too. This feedback loop in the design will help buyers trust the quality of the bike.<br/><br/>
                                The goal was to have a standardised metric for trustworthiness of products sold. We wanted some means to help buyers take one glance at the listing and judge how good the bike was going to be. For this, the bike needs to be vetting by somebody who can distinguish between good and poor quality bikes. Which is why we included an expert in our design. However, we realised that employing experts wouldn’t be a scalable solution, and hence the community of experts. Our inspiration was the Uber driver model, where anybody can find work at any time. We believe through this model, experts can earn income by reviewing bikes for sale.<br/></p>

                                <p>In this design, potential buyers simply enters the price range of bike and prefered size and weight.

Then, he/she would get a code number for a box which would hold the key for the bike. The buyer can just go to the place at any time he wants and use the key to unlock the bike. (Addresses problems: time consuming to negotiate and comparing bikes, trust of quality of bike, time consuming to post information, delivery and accessibility)</p>

                                <p>Customers give a range for budget on the main page, and a recommendation for the bike will be provided to the buyer on the second page. With a video with full descriptions of the bike, customers would be able to take a quick look at the bike’s information, and arrive at a decision. The customer would have two options: “Yes” to accept this offer or “Reload” to reject and look for another one. If the buyer chooses to accept the bike, the buyer will be shown another window to pay for the bike. After finishing the purchase process, the buyer will receive information about where to collect the bike. The buyer will also receive the code of the bike to unlock the bike.<br/><br/>
                                <b><li>Reason for Design</li></b>
                                One of the biggest pain points of customers is that customers are always looking for low-price bikes. During an interview, a participant responded that when he looked for a second hand bike he just wanted a basic one without elaborate functions. This feedback also matched our result from surveys. The interviewee said he just a basic one with good quality and what he cared was whether it would work well. Moreover, we also found that they always tend to spend most of the time in negotiating the price and looking for low-price bikes. Especially for people those who do not look for specific requirements of a used bike, price might be their foremost, or even the only concern. The survey result also showed that the most important reason for buying second hand bike is because it is cheap.<br/><br/>
                                So our design idea here is to help solve these pain points by minimizing the comparing process. Since we found that the price is what user are most concerned about and their requirements for the bike is not so specific. We design the ‘instant buy’ as a system where the user just enters their budget and then are given a single choice for a bike. We believe this design can meet user’s need and solve their problem too. Also the bike’s quality is ensured by the volunteer.<br/><br/> 
                                The goal in the pickup and drop location was to understand how buyers and sellers could meet at a common location that is accessible for both. The simplest way to represent accessibility was through a map. We decided to let sellers first share their location on a map, on where they plan to have their bike. We would also give the seller a lock operated by the app to use to lock the bike. The reason was to avoid exchange of keys between all the parties involved in the transaction - since that would be tedious and time-consuming.<br/><br/> 
                                Once the drop is done, we wanted to notify the staff to take videos of the bike. This design would also solve the delivery problem. The buyer and seller can arrange the time and save their time on negotiation on where to meet.<br/></p>

By scrolling down the “Home” page, there is a section called “One Click Away”, whose function is to offer a recommendation to the customer with budget solely. After tying the budget in and click at Go button, the page will transfer to “One Click Away” page.<br/><br/> 

                            In the “One Click Away” page, videos of both close-ups of bike and someone riding it on are displayed. Users are offered three options: <br/>1. Return back by clicking at logo <br/>2. Clicking at “Reload” icon, reload the bike (change another recommendation)<br/> 3. Confirm the deal after clicking at the “Yes” icon.
