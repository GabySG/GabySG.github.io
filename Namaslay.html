                                The chosen product of our project is headphones, which has a large user base. Headphones are now used to listen to music and podcasts or you can use them to speak to others during a call. They are used while working out, gaming, walking, or just lounging around. They have many uses and purposes, making them an interesting and fun product to explore.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Our project is to help headphone users to</b><br/><br/>
                                o	Help them to quickly spot the headphone they need & want<br/>
                                o	Decrease the time they were looking for the ideal one in a physical store<br/><br/><br/>
                                
                                
                                <h2><p>Approach</p></h2>
                                <p>The team started with two kinds of online websites (with all brands and websites with one specific brand) for headphones information. Then we conducted in-person <b>observations</b> and <b>semi-structured interviews</b> to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behavior.</p>
                                
                                <p>Then we did <b>contextual inquiries</b>, and distributed a <b>survey</b> to identify problems that they face during purchasing in a physical store. Based on the data gathered, we did <b>affinity diagram</b> to categorize collected data. We used findings from the affinity diagram to develop user journey maps and personas.</p>  

                                <p>These processes helped us understand our users better, and we identified problems in their headphone-purchasing experience. Then we organized divergent brainstorming <b>design</b> sessions with divergent design ideas. After doing a thorough analysis of their feasibility, creativity and to the biggest extent they can solve main problems, we then converged to # design ideas.</p> 

                                <p>The ideas were presented to our class peers for feedback and evaluation by <b>storyboards</b>, <b>wireframes</b>. After multiple iterations, we came up with a mobile application called Nama-slay with a detailed user flow.</p> 
                                
                                
                                <h2><p>My role</p></h2>
                                <p>I participated throughout the research process of <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>interviews</b> and <b>survey</b>. I took charge of the <b>contextual inquiry</b>, <b>affinity diagram</b>, and skeching <b>journey maps</b> and <b>personas</b> by collecting the findings. I also came up with two main design ideas which ended up as our final solution. Besides, I created Lo-fi Hi-fi designs via <b>Axure</b>, <b>Sketch</b> and <b>Figma</b>.</p>

                                <p>We initially conducted observations to observe their purchase process. They we did semi-structured interviews with users to find out the reasons behind their purchase, where they have looked for and what problems they have faced, and with salesperson who can share a summary of their interactions with users and best-selling products. After the first two steps, we distributed a survey with close-end questions which we are sure about the problem scope and open-end questions, which might bring us more surprises.</p>

                                <p>Then we decided to have an in-depth understanding of purchasing experience by doing contextual inquiry. After combining results of first-round survey and contextual inquiry, we did a second-round survey, which focused more on their thinking of problems what we extracted.</p><br/>

                                <p>We conducted several in-person observations and semi-structured interviews at many local stores such as Best Buy, Apple, Target, and Barnes and Noble. We chose those research methods, since our objective was to have participants show/tell us how they shopped so that we may understand their purchase behaviour. We did not want to go with a structured interview or a survey initially, since we did not have sufficient information yet, to delve deeper into the problems buyers face currently.</p></div>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>At the Barnes and Noble we visited, there were two separate locations within the electronics section where headphones were displayed. One location had colorful packages of various brands of earbuds such as Skullcandy and Gumy. All of the headphones in this section had price tags. Items in this section were arranged by price, generally the cheapest ($9.98-$30) ones were the most accessible, followed the next price bracket (>$40) being in the locked lower section of the rack. The most expensive headphones (>$100) were kept in the top section. The other section was a small counter where speakers and headphones were set up for the purpose of letting customers try them on. There were no prices listed in this section. We noticed after multiple visits that these headphones were changed on occasion, though we are uncertain of the interval at which these products are swapped out.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Apple Store had mostly Beats headphones throughout the store, possibly due to their branding strategies, and their deal of offering a pair of Beats headphones with the purchase of a Macbook. They had locations where you could listen to various sets of over-ear headphones, as well as a place to hook your phone into the headphones. The other brands that they offered were i.am+, Pioneer, Freedom, and Bose. However, these other brands were often higher up on the shelves, and the Beats headphones were always at eye level. They also had sale associates there ready to help and answer any questions the consumers might have.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

                                <p><br/>At the Target that we visited, there was only one aisle dedicated to headphones in the electronics section. The layout seemed very condensed compared to other stores we visited. On the side closer to the main walkway, there were brightly lit displays with singular pairs of headphones being shown off, and slightly further in, the displays had some headphones that you could try on. Beats had the largest display there, but there were also displays for Skullcandy, Jaybird, and UBL brand headphones. Underneath these displays were locked cabinets containing boxes of the headphones displayed below, whose prices ranged from $100-$200.</p>
                                <p>Past the displays, there were simply racks of wireless headphones in boxes. These wireless headphones ranged from $50-$200 in price and were locked to the racks themselves. With expensive items on display, it is not surprising that Target would like to deter shoplifting.</p>
                                <p>Further along was a rack full of earbuds. Simply packaged, mostly on sale, and none of them locked. These headphones were never more than $30, and must have been left unlocked as they were not worth the deterrent.</p>

                                <p><br/><br/>We visited two different Best Buy locations with slightly different layouts. However, there were features between the stores that were similar. All of the racks were about 5-6 feet tall, allowing for some customers to see over them. The stores had 2 aisles dedicated to headphones. One aisle was dedicated to displays with headphones to try on, where the headphones had specialty controls, and video displays that would show off various features of the headphones. Below those displays, there were various boxes of headphones from similar brands. The brands on this aisle were mostly Sony, Skullcandy, and Beats headphones. On the other Aisle, there were more displays for trying on headphones (Bose), but the other half of the aisle was a rack of wireless headphones and earbuds. When speaking to a store representative, they said that the most common feature they were asked about was comfort, which may have led to more space in the store being used for trying on headphones. There were also sections where a customer could plug in their phone to use their own sound to test the headphones.</p><br/></div>
